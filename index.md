## Running the Scrips

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `build_lab.sh` and `submit_lab.sh` scripts are located using the `cd` command.
3. Make the scripts executable by running the following command:

> chmod +x buildlab.sh push_lab.sh


4. Run the script by entering its name in the terminal:

> ./<script_name>.sh


The script will prompt you to enter the lab number and then run the appropriate commands.
