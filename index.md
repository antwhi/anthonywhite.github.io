## Running a Bash Script

To run a Bash script, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located using the `cd` command.
3. Make the script executable by running the following command:

### chmod +x script_name.sh


Replace `script_name.sh` with the name of your script.

4. Run the script by entering its name in the terminal:

### ./script_name.sh


Again, replace `script_name.sh` with the name of your script.

## Example

Let's say you have a Bash script called `submit_lab.sh` that you want to run. Here's how you would do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `submit_lab.sh` script is located using the `cd` command.
3. Make the script executable by running the following command:

### chmod +x submit_lab.sh


4. Run the script by entering its name in the terminal:

### ./submit_lab.sh


The script will prompt you to enter the lab number and then run the required commands to submit the lab.
