## Running the Scrips

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `lab_build.sh` and `lab_submit.sh` scripts are located using the `cd` command.
3. Make the scripts executable by running the following command:

> chmod +x lab_build.sh lab_submit.sh


4. When you've finished the lab, run the build script by entering its name in the terminal:

> ./lab_build.sh

This will create the build directory, run cmake and make tests.

5. When you're ready to submit, run the submit script.

The script will prompt you to enter the lab number and then run the appropriate commands.
